The salaryman has dozed off in the middle of a shift due to fatigue. He dreams about many things that he is longing for, but also things that drive him up the wall. Help him have a good dream by collecting good thoughts and avoiding bad thoughts!

PS : for an experimental mode of the game, type 'celery' after the rules box appears
